## Best places to visit in Jaipur

 
### Sunrise at Hawa Mahal
Watch fascinatingly carved windows of the Palace of Winds, Hawa Mahal, light up with the sun. Right on the main road, all you need to do is wake up early for a perfect start to your day with the silhouette of Hawa Mahal against the brightening sky.

### Masterchef Jaipur
Get friendly with a local family, getting to know more about their traditions and culture, as they give you a quick MasterChef session on Rajasthani food. Dishes could vary, depending on the season you’re visiting in, from millet flatbread (bajre ki roti), legumes (fali) and stuffed pepper (Mirchi bada) to lentil-infused hard wheat rolls (daal baati). Enjoy your very own home-cooked Rajasthani meal with the family, and don’t forget to take notes.
