## Places to Visit in Sri Lanka

1. Seema Malaka Temple, Beira Lake, `Colombo´

" The capital city combines modern urban amenities with the country's colorful indigenous and colonial history. As a key stop on the world spice trade routes, Sri Lanka has long held strategic importance for European trading powers. The country has been a colony of Portugal, the Netherlands, and most recently the British, and all these cultures blend with the Indigenous culture to form a wonderful hybrid. You can taste these influences in the food, see them in the architecture and the arts, and you can really feel them in Colombo.

The city is also filled with museums and other things to do that can help connect you with Sri Lankan culture. Colombo sits on the coast, and there's a large green space and beach area right in the heart of the city separating an area called Fort from the Indian Ocean. It's the city's public playground and a fun place to visit, especially on Friday and Saturday nights.

The city's new mega-tower, the Colombo Lotus Tower, is a great place to visit. The tallest free-standing tower in Southeast Asia, it provides amazing views of the city. Aside from indoor and outdoor observation areas, there's a fancy restaurant at the top and a popular food court in the mall at the tower base."


2. Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, `Kandy´

" Kandy is where you go to learn about and experience Sri Lankan history. Located in central Sri Lanka, the city is the former capital city of the Sri Lankan royal dynasty, the country's main capital before the colonial period. The high point of what's called the "Kandian Era" was between the 15th and 18th centuries, when the area remained independent while most of the coastal regions were colonized by European powers.

Be sure to visit the city's National Museum of Kandy, as it illustrates the story of the region and its people via exhibits and artifacts. Nearby, the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is a very holy Buddhist shrine, part of the royal palace complex. Kandy Lake is at the heart of the city and offers a peaceful refuge from the heat. There are hiking paths that circle the lake, dotted with temples and shrines.

Kandy is surrounded by mountains, which are home to many tea plantations. Some can be visited and offer tours and tea tastings. It's also surrounded by rainforests. The Udawatta Kele Sanctuary is a forest park located within the city limits. The forest reserve has miles of hiking trails, as well as an excellent nature center with educational information. "


3. Abhayagiri dagoba in `Anuradhapura´

" A visit to Anuradhapura, one of the country's ancient capitals and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, rewards visitors with a glimpse into the past. The area is unique, as there's a thriving, modern town adjacent to an ancient one – you're not just visiting ruins. The current population makes it one of the oldest continuously inhabited places on earth (starting in the 4th century, BCE).

The ruins are awesome, with many crumbling temples, statues, pools, and other structures. There are modern structures, too, and the temple remains an active place of worship. The core of the complex is a very old tree. The Sri Maha Bodhi is believed to be the world's oldest living tree planted by a human.

Anuradhapura is a fun place to visit, as there are a lot of small guesthouses and cheap places to eat, along with bike rental, tour guides, and other businesses catering to tourists. "

4. Buddhist ruins in `Pollonnaruwa´

" This is an important ancient city ruin site, another one of the country's World Heritage Sites. Pollonnaruwa was Sri Lanka's second capital city, after Anuradhapura, thriving about a thousand years ago.

The garden-city is completely preserved, although most of the structures are in ruins. There are gardens, palaces, and temples, and while it's rather compact, it's best explored by bicycle. A bonus, the ruins are inhabited by a large troop of macaque monkeys, also residents of the area since ancient times. Duran Duran fans will recognize the site, as their Save a Prayer video was filmed here in the 1980s.

There's a small, modern town a few miles from the ruins, with guesthouses, bike rentals, cafés, and other tourist services. The town is close to Minneriya National Park, a great place to elephant-watch. "

5. Train on the Nine Arch Bridge near `Ella´

" Sometimes it's as much about the journey as it is about the destination. An example of this is Ella, a small, hill-country town set among Sri Lanka's lush tea plantations. It's filled with small guesthouses, amazing food, and very friendly people. It's a fun getaway from the city or a way to enjoy a few days of leisurely hiking in the countryside.

A big reason people visit Ella is to ride the train from Kandy. Slowly, it winds its way up and down hills, through small towns, across green tea fields, until finally arriving in the small mountain town after about six hours. The ride is considered one of the most beautiful train journeys in the world. You can also start the journey in Colombo, which adds three hours to the trip. "
